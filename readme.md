DATA MINING WITH PYTHON

Written Code in python used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. It is devised to operate on a database containing a lot of transactions, for instance, items brought by customers in a store. As there is a #python module called #apriori which helps us to perform #data #mining on #transaction data which provides the association between different items in data set which further used by the different companies.


The ouput changes as it provide more association if we change the parameter “min_support” value  in apriori fuction. Max value of this parameter is 1 which is 100 percent support min value is 0 where it show all the associations.


For better understanding a example program and output of that program provided in apriori_example folder.
